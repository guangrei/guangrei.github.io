## Winter Is The Time Of Year When Many People Enjoy Spending Time Indoors

Winter is the season of the year when many people begin spending most of their time indoors. You’ll want to get outdoors this winter to boost your productivity.

The blending of days isn’t mentally healthy for anyone — so let’s mix it up a little by adding outdoor activities to our Calendar.

Yes, this is about how to spend all winter inside, but fresh air is key, especially since 2020 has probably given you a major case of cabin fever. As social connection is essential for mental and emotional health, many people are opting outdoors to see their friends and family. In Minnesota, that means layering up and potentially investing in outdoor warmers or a bonfire pit for much-needed social time, or embarking on outdoor adventures like cross-country skiing.
